# Shopping List App

## Software Summary

I built a super simple app that acts as a shopping list.  You can type in items that you need.  When you are finished, you can exit from the app, and it will show you what is currently on your shopping list.

## Built With

* Python3

## Version History

**Version 1.0**  
*3/19/2018*  
* Strictly speaking, this isn't my first bit of Python code that I've ever written, but it's the first in some time.  It's nice to get back to it.
