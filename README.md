# Shopping List App

## Software Summary

I built a super simple app that acts as a shopping list.  You can type in items that you need, display your current list of items, and ask for help if needed.  When you are finished, you can exit from the app, and it will display your completed shopping list.

## Built With

* Python 3.6.4

## Version History

**Version 1.0**  
*3/19/2018*  
* Strictly speaking, this isn't my first bit of Python code that I've ever written, but it's the first in some time.  It's nice to get back to it.
* I noticed the spacing between lines of text while running the app seems to grow narrower or wider depending on the medium used; I tried my best to make the spacing only appear as double-spaced and not much wider.

**Version 1.1**  
*3/22/2018*  
* I ended up refactoring a bit by placing some of the code into functions.
* I re-organized the order of the code and updated the comments.
